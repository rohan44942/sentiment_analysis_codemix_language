## Code-Mixed Sentiment Analysis Using Hybrid Deep Learning Models
Overview
This project aims to classify code-mixed (Hindi-English) social media text into positive or negative sentiments using a hybrid model of CNN, LSTM, and AdaBoost classifiers.

The project presented encompasses two main models: a sentiment analysis model for Hindi-English code-mixed sentences and a food recommendation system based on user emotions.

The sentiment analysis model developed in this project is a robust data analytics tool designed to classify the sentiment of Hindi-English code-mixed sentences into positive or negative categories. Achieving an accuracy of over _**85%**, this model is primarily intended for research purposes. It has significant applications in improving the quality of products on e-commerce websites by interpreting user reviews and in identifying offensive comments on social media platforms. This can also assist the government in understanding public feedback from social media. Future work will involve extending this model to perform sentiment analysis on sentences extracted from videos and handling multiple languages using hybrid deep learning models.
